s = "rafsan"
s = (s[0:2])[::-1] + s[2:]
print(s)
# Output:

# arfsan

# In Python, you cannot modify a string directly because strings are **immutable**. The line `s[0:2] = (s[0:2])[::-1]` will raise an error because you're trying to assign a new value to a slice of the string, which is not allowed.

# If you want to reverse part of the string and update `s`, you need to create a new string by concatenating slices. Here's how you can do it:

# ```python
# s = "rafsan"
# s = (s[0:2])[::-1] + s[2:]
# print(s)
# ```

# Explanation:
# - `(s[0:2])[::-1]` reverses the first two characters (`"ra"` becomes `"ar"`).
# - `s[2:]` takes the remaining part of the string (`"fsan"`).
# - These two parts are concatenated to form the new string.
