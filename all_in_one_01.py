# Sure! Here's a **structured list of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) topics in Python**, starting from the basics and moving toward more advanced concepts:

# ### 1. **Classes and Objects**
#    - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a bundle of variables and methods).
#    - **Object**: An instance of a class.
#    - Example: 
#      ```python
#      class Person:
#          pass

#      p1 = Person()  # Object of class Person
#      ```

# ### 2. **Attributes and Methods**
#    - **Attributes**: Variables that belong to a class (or object).
#    - **Methods**: Functions that belong to a class (or object).
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Car:
#          def __init__(self, make, model):
#              self.make = make  # Attribute
#              self.model = model

#          def display_info(self):  # Method
#              print(f"{self.make} {self.model}")
#      ```

# ### 3. **Constructor (`__init__` method)**
#    - Special method called automatically when an object is created.
#    - Used to initialize attributes.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Student:
#          def __init__(self, roll, gpa):
#              self.roll = roll
#              self.gpa = gpa
#      ```

# ### 4. **Instance Variables and Class Variables**
#    - **Instance Variables**: Unique to each object.
#    - **Class Variables**: Shared among all instances of a class.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Employee:
#          company_name = "TechCorp"  # Class variable

#          def __init__(self, name):
#              self.name = name  # Instance variable
#      ```

# ### 5. **Encapsulation**
#    - Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
#    - **Private attributes**: Attributes prefixed with `_` or `__` to indicate they should not be accessed directly from outside the class.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class BankAccount:
#          def __init__(self, balance):
#              self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

#          def deposit(self, amount):
#              self.__balance += amount
#      ```

# ### 6. **Inheritance**
#    - Allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent).
#    - **Single Inheritance**: One parent, one child.
#    - **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from multiple parent classes.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Animal:
#          def speak(self):
#              print("Animal speaks")

#      class Dog(Animal):  # Inheritance
#          def bark(self):
#              print("Dog barks")
#      ```

# ### 7. **Method Overriding**
#    - The child class can override (replace) methods from the parent class.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Animal:
#          def speak(self):
#              print("Animal speaks")

#      class Dog(Animal):
#          def speak(self):  # Method overriding
#              print("Dog barks")
#      ```

# ### 8. **Polymorphism**
#    - Allows the same method to have different implementations.
#    - Achieved through method overriding and method overloading.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Bird:
#          def fly(self):
#              print("Bird flies")

#      class Airplane:
#          def fly(self):
#              print("Airplane flies")
#      ```

# ### 9. **Abstraction**
#    - Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
#    - Achieved using abstract base classes (ABC module) in Python.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

#      class Shape(ABC):
#          @abstractmethod
#          def area(self):
#              pass
#      ```

# ### 10. **`super()` Function**
#    - Used to call a method from the parent class in a child class.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Parent:
#          def show(self):
#              print("Parent method")

#      class Child(Parent):
#          def show(self):
#              super().show()  # Calling parent's method
#              print("Child method")
#      ```

# ### 11. **Dunder Methods (Magic Methods)**
#    - Special methods that start and end with double underscores (`__`), such as `__init__`, `__str__`, `__len__`, etc.
#    - Used to define the behavior of objects for built-in operations.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Book:
#          def __init__(self, title):
#              self.title = title

#          def __str__(self):
#              return f"Book title: {self.title}"
#      ```

# ### 12. **Operator Overloading**
#    - Define or modify the behavior of operators for user-defined classes.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Number:
#          def __init__(self, value):
#              self.value = value

#          def __add__(self, other):
#              return self.value + other.value
#      ```

# ### 13. **Multiple Inheritance**
#    - A class can inherit from multiple classes.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class A:
#          def feature1(self):
#              print("Feature 1 from A")

#      class B:
#          def feature2(self):
#              print("Feature 2 from B")

#      class C(A, B):  # Inheriting from both A and B
#          pass
#      ```

# ### 14. **Class Methods and Static Methods**
#    - **Class Methods**: Declared with `@classmethod` and take the class (`cls`) as the first parameter.
#    - **Static Methods**: Declared with `@staticmethod` and donâ€™t take `self` or `cls` as parameters.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class Math:
#          @classmethod
#          def class_method(cls):
#              print("Class method")

#          @staticmethod
#          def static_method():
#              print("Static method")
#      ```

# ### 15. **Object Serialization (Pickling)**
#    - Saving (serializing) objects to files and loading them back (deserializing).
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      import pickle

#      class Student:
#          def __init__(self, name, grade):
#              self.name = name
#              self.grade = grade

#      student = Student("Alice", "A")
#      with open("student.pkl", "wb") as file:
#          pickle.dump(student, file)
#      ```

# ### 16. **Decorators in OOP**
#    - Decorators can be applied to methods in OOP, especially useful for class methods or static methods.
#    - Example:
#      ```python
#      class User:
#          @staticmethod
#          def welcome():
#              print("Welcome, user!")
#      ```
